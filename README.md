# Prompt Inspiration

This project is a web application powered by a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The frontend handles the user interface, while the backend provides data processing and serves the API.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following key files:

- **`src/App.js`**: The main React component for the frontend UI.
- **`src/App.css`**: Styling for the React components.
- **`backend/main2.py`**: The FastAPI backend script.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** for the frontend
- **Python** for the backend
- **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn** for serving the backend API

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies for the FastAPI backend:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main2:app --reload
    ```

   The backend will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2. Install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Descriptions

### `src/App.js`

This file defines the main React component of the frontend. It includes the applicationâ€™s main UI components, handling user inputs and interactions.

### `src/App.css`

This CSS file provides styling for the `App.js` component. It controls layout, colors, and overall visual design.

### `backend/main2.py`

This is the FastAPI backend file. It contains the API endpoints that interact with the frontend, processes data, and sends responses.

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server as explained in the backend setup.
2. Start the React development server as explained in the frontend setup.
3. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will communicate with the FastAPI backend for API calls.
